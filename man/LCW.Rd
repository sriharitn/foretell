\title{Latent Class Weibull (LCW) Model for Projecting Customer Retention}
\usage{
LCW(
  surv_value,
  h,
  lower = c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001),
  upper = c(0.99999, 10000, 0.999999, 10000, 0.99999)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{surv_value}{a numeric vector of historical customer retention percentage should start at 100 and non-starting values should be between 0 and less than 100}

\item{h}{forecasting horizon}

\item{lower}{lower limit used in \code{R} \code{optim} rotuine. Default is \code{c(0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001)}.}

\item{upper}{upper limit used in \code{R} \code{optim} rotuine. Default is \code{c(0.99999,10000,0.999999,10000,0.99999)}.}
}
\value{
\item{fitted:}{Fitted Values based on historical data}
\item{projected:}{Projected \code{h} values based on historical data}
\item{max.likelihood:}{Maximum Likelihood of LCW}
\item{params - t1,t2,c1,c2,w:}{Returns t1,c1,t2,c2,w paramters from maximum likelihood estimation}
}
\description{
\code{LCW} is a latent class weibull model implementation based on \code{Fader and Hardie} probability based projection methedology. The survivor function for \code{LCW} is \deqn{wS(t|t1,c1)+(1-w)S(t|t2,c2), 0<w<1}
}
